# yt-analysis
This is a repository of a data analysis and visualization project I made. The Python script scrapes a YouTube channel and displays certain pieces of data in graph form.

## YT-Analysis
This Python script takes in a YouTube channel id. From this id, the Python script uses the YouTube API, Pandas, and Seaborn to scrape the webpage, convert the data to a table, and display the data. The data scraped are things such as videos (with each video's respective view count, like count, comments, etc) and subscriber count. 

**Successes**
- Sucessfully scraped data from YouTube
- Displays said data in visual form

**Room for Improvement**
- Project as a whole isn't too complex
- No analysis done with the data that I couldn't do otherwise

**Takeaways**
- First time working with the YouTube API
- First time scraping the web
- Learned how to visualize data with Seaborn
